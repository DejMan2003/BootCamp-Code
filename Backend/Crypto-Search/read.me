Introduction

This README provides instructions on how to activate and run two HTML-based code examples: Crypto-Search and Form Example. The Crypto-Search displays cryptocurrency information, while the Form Example allows users to submit data through different HTTP methods.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
A local server environment (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or a simple HTTP server)
Setup Instructions

Crypto-Search
Save the HTML File:

Create a file named crypto_search.html and paste the Crypto-Search code into this file.
Create a Background Image:

Ensure you have a background image named beehive.jpeg in the same directory as crypto_search.html.
Install a Template Engine (optional):

If the code contains template syntax like <%= sym %>, you will need a server-side template engine like EJS.
Example for Node.js: npm install ejs
Form Example
Save the HTML File:

Create a file named form_example.html and paste the Form Example code into this file.
Backend Setup:

The form example uses different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), which require a backend server to handle the requests.
Set up a server (e.g., using Node.js with Express):
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.get('/get-secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`GET request received: ${JSON.stringify(req.query)}`);
});

app.post('/post-secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`POST request received: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});

app.put('/put-secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`PUT request received: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});

app.patch('/patch-secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`PATCH request received: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});

app.delete('/delete-secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`DELETE request received: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
Running the Applications

Crypto-Search
Open the HTML File:
Open crypto_search.html in your web browser.
View the Content:
The page will display cryptocurrency information with a background image.
Form Example
Start the Backend Server:
If you are using the provided Node.js example, run node your_server_file.js to start the server.
Open the HTML File:
Open form_example.html in your web browser.
Submit the Form:
Fill in the form fields and click the corresponding button to send the request. The response will be displayed in the response area.
Additional Notes

Ensure that your local server is running and accessible from your browser.
Adjust the server port and routes as necessary to match your setup.
For enhanced functionality and security, consider validating and sanitizing user inputs on the server side.
This guide should help you activate and run the provided code examples. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation of the tools and libraries you are using.
