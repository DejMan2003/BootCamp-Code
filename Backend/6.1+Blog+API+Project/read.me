Description

This code represents a basic backend server using Express.js along with Axios for making HTTP requests. It provides API endpoints for CRUD operations on posts, including creating, updating, and deleting posts. Additionally, it serves static files for a simple frontend application.

Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

Install Node.js if you haven't already.
Clone this repository or create a new directory for your project.
Install dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Run the server by executing node app.js or npm start in the terminal.
Dependencies

Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the API.
Endpoints

GET /: Renders the main page with a list of posts.
GET /new: Renders the page for creating a new post.
GET /edit/:id: Renders the page for editing a specific post.
POST /api/posts: Creates a new post.
POST /api/posts/:id: Updates a specific post.
GET /api/posts/delete/:id: Deletes a specific post.
Static Files

The server serves static files from the "public" directory. You can place your HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files in this directory.

Error Handling

If there's an error fetching posts, creating a post, updating a post, or deleting a post, the server responds with a 500 status code and an error message.
Configuration

The port for the server is set to 3000 by default. You can change it by modifying the port variable in the code.
Notes

This code assumes that there's a separate frontend application to interact with the backend API. The frontend can make requests to the provided API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on posts.
